# Scorekeeper

An unncessary scorekeeping app for retired people.

## Local Development

```
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

## TODO

Things to do before focusing on the UX:

* [ ] Error handling on game client
* [ ] Migrate production data from old app
* [ ] Data model for game statistics (totals, leaders, etc.)
* [ ] Write test to access real database
* [ ] SQL to restore database schema?
* [ ] Vercel deployment
